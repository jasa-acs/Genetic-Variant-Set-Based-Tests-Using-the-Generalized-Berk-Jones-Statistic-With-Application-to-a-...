Requirements to reproduce Supplementary Figures 7 and 8:

(a) You will need to have installed the following R libraries on your computing platform:
dplyr, data.table.

(b) You will need all the output from gen_data_tab2.R (run on the original data). If you do 
not have access to the original data, unfortunately you will not be able to reproduce our QQ-plots.

(c) Once you have verified that all the above requirements are met, open all files with a 
.R extension and edit the first line of executable code to set library/data file paths 
as directed by the comments.  These will tell R where to load your libraries and find
the data files.


Workflow to reproduce Supplementary Figures 7 and 8:

(1) Run plot_suppfig78.R from within an R console.

This will reproduce Supplementary Figures 7 and 8 IF you have the original data.
