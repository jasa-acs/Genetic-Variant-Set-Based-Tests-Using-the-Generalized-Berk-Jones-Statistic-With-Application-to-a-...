Requirements to reproduce Supplementary Tables 3 and 4:

(a) You will need to have installed the following R libraries on your computing platform:
GBJ, SKAT, mvtnorm, bindata, data.table, dyplr.

(b) You will need access to a computing cluster.  We provide job submission scripts for 
LSF (bsub extension) and SLURM (sbatch extension) environments. You may need
to edit these scripts slightly to ensure that relevant parameters (number of cores, 
amount of time requested, etc.) are in line with your computing facility rules. In 
particular, you will need to edit the queue name (the string after '-q' flag) to reflect
the actual name of your partition.

(c) Once you have verified that all the above requirements are met, open all files with a 
.R extension and edit the first line of executable code to set library/data file paths 
as directed by the comments.  These will tell R where to load your libraries and find
the data files.


Workflow to reproduce Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.

(1) From the command line of your cluster computing environment, type
either 'bsub <run_suppfig3_part1.bsub' or 'sbatch run_suppfig3_part1.sbatch' (without the quotes)
and press ENTER.

(2) Repeat step (1) with the .bsub/.sbatch scripts marked parts 2-4 and also those starting with run_suppfig4.

(3) Once all the jobs from steps (1)-(2) have finished, run make_supptab34.R from within an R console.

This will reproduce all the plots from Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.
