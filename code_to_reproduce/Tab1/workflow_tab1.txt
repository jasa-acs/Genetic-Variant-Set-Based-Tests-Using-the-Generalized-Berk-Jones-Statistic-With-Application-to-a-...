Requirements to reproduce Table 1:

(a) You will need to have installed the following R libraries on your computing platform:
GBJ, SKAT, mvtnorm, data.table.

(b) You will need the HAPGEN2 binary (download at 
http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/hapgen/hapgen2.html) in your working directory.

(c) You will need reference data from the HapMap3 project 
(download at https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/data_download_hapmap3_r2.html) in your 
working directory. Specifically, you will need the chromosome 5 files 'hapmap3.r2.b36.chr5.legend', 
'genetic_map_chr5_combined_b36.txt', and 'CEU.chr5.hap'. 

(d) You will also need the chromosome 10
files hapmap3.r2.b36.chr10.legend', 'genetic_map_chr10_combined_b36.txt', and 'CEU.chr10.hap'.

(e) You will need to put the 'glist-hg18.txt' file included in this folder in your working directory.

(f) You will need access to a computing cluster.  We provide job submission scripts for 
LSF (bsub extension) and SLURM (sbatch extension) environments. You may need
to edit these scripts slightly to ensure that relevant parameters (number of cores, 
amount of time requested, etc.) are in line with your computing facility rules. In 
particular, you will need to edit the queue name (the string after '-q' flag) to reflect
the actual name of your partition.

(g) Once you have verified that all the above requirements are met, open all files with a 
.R extension and edit the first line of executable code to set library/data file paths 
as directed by the comments.  These will tell R where to load your libraries and find
the data files.


Workflow to reproduce Table 1:

(1) From the command line of your cluster computing environment, type
either 'bsub <run_tab1_part1.bsub' or 'sbatch run_tab1_part1.sbatch' and
press ENTER.

(2) Then type either 'bsub <run_tab1_part2.bsub' or 'sbatch run_tab1_part2.sbatch' and
press ENTER.

(3) Run gen_data_tab1_part3.R from within an R console.

(4) Once all the jobs from steps (1), (2), and (3) have finished, run make_tab1.R from within an R console.
A very close approximation of the results from Table 1 will be stored in the variables results_tab1, 
results_tab2, and results_tab3 (not a perfect reproduction because we cannot control the random number
generator of HAPGEN - it sets a seed according to the time of day).
