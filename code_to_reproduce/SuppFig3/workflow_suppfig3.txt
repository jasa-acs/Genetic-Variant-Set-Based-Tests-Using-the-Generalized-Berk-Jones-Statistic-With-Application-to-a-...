Requirements to reproduce Supplementary Figure 3:

(a) You will need to have installed the dplyr R library on your computing platform.

(b) You will need to have completed all the steps necessary to reproduce Figure 1.

(c) Once you have verified that all the above requirements are met, open all files with a 
.R extension and edit the first line of executable code to set library/data file paths 
as directed by the comments.  These will tell R where to load your libraries and find
the data files.

Workflow to reproduce Supplementary Figure 3:

(1) Run plot_suppfig3.R from within an R console.

This will reproduce all the plots from Supplementary Figure 3.
