Requirements to reproduce Figure 1:

(a) You will need to have installed the 'GBJ' R library on your computing platform.

(b) You will need the Boost C++ libraries. Download them at 
http: //www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_65_1.html and unzip the files.

(c) You will need a C++ binary for calculating supremum-based global test p-values.
The ebb_crossprob_cor.cpp file and associated Makefile are attached.
Put them in your working directory, which is the directory  where you will be running all your commands.  
Open the Makefile and change the second line to point at the directory that holds the 'boost' folder
unzipped in part (b).
Navigate to the working directory on the command line, type 'make' without the quotation marks, and press ENTER.

(c) You will need access to a computing cluster.  We provide job submission scripts for 
LSF (bsub extension) and SLURM (sbatch extension) environments. You may need
to edit these scripts slightly to ensure that relevant parameters (number of cores, 
amount of time requested, etc.) are in line with your computing facility rules. In 
particular, you will need to edit the queue name (the string after '-q' flag) to reflect
the actual name of your partition.

(d) Once you have verified that all the above requirements are met, open all files with a 
.R extension and edit the first line of executable code to set library/data file paths 
as directed by the comments.  These will tell R where to load your libraries and find
the data files.


Workflow to reproduce Figure 1:

(1) From the command line of your cluster computing environment, type
 either 'bsub <run_GOF_bounds.bsub' or 'sbatch run_GOF_bounds.sbatch' (without the quotes)
and press ENTER.

(2) Once all the jobs from step (1) have finished, run plot_fig1.R from within an R console.

This will reproduce all the plots from Fig 1.
