Requirements to reproduce Supplementary Figures 1 and 2:

(a) You will need to have installed the 'GBJ', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and 'data.table' R libraries on your computing platform.

(b) You will need the HAPGEN2 binary (download at 
http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/hapgen/hapgen2.html) in your working directory.

(c) You will need reference data from the HapMap3 project 
(download at https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/data_download_hapmap3_r2.html) in your 
working directory. Specifically, you will need 'hapmap3.r2.b36.chr5.legend', 
'genetic_map_chr5_combined_b36.txt', and 'CEU.chr5.hap' from the HapMap3 files.

(d) You will need access to a computing cluster.  We provide job submission scripts for 
LSF (bsub extension) and SLURM (sbatch extension) environments. You may need
to edit these scripts slightly to ensure that relevant parameters (number of cores, 
amount of time requested, etc.) are in line with your computing facility rules. In 
particular, you will need to edit the queue name (the string after '-q' flag) to reflect
the actual name of your partition.

(e) Once you have verified that all the above requirements are met, open all files with a 
.R extension and edit the first line of executable code to set library/data file paths 
as directed by the comments.  These will tell R where to load your libraries and find
the data files.


Workflow to reproduce Supplementary Figures 1 and 2:

(1) From the command line of your cluster computing environment, type
 either 'bsub <run_suppfig1_part1.bsub' or 'sbatch run_suppfig1_part1.sbatch' (without the quotes)
and press ENTER.

(2) From the command line of your cluster computing environment, type
 either 'bsub <run_suppfig1_part2.bsub' or 'sbatch run_suppfig1_part2.sbatch' (without the quotes)
and press ENTER.

(3) Once all the jobs from steps (1) and (2) have finished, run plot_suppfig1_and2.R from within an R console.

This will reproduce all the plots from Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.
