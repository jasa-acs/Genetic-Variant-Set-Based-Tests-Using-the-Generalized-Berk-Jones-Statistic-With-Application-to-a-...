Requirements to reproduce Figure 4:

(a) You will need to have installed the following R libraries on your computing platform:
GBJ, SKAT, mvtnorm, data.table.

(b) You will need the HAPGEN2 binary (download at 
http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/hapgen/hapgen2.html) in your working directory.

(c) You will need reference data from the HapMap3 project 
(download at https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/data_download_hapmap3_r2.html) in your 
working directory. Specifically, you will need 'hapmap3.r2.b36.chr5.legend', 
'genetic_map_chr5_combined_b36.txt', and 'CEU.chr5.hap' from the HapMap3 files.

(d) You will need access to a computing cluster.  We provide job submission scripts for 
LSF (bsub extension) and SLURM (sbatch extension) environments. You may need
to edit these scripts slightly to ensure that relevant parameters (number of cores, 
amount of time requested, etc.) are in line with your computing facility rules. In 
particular, you will need to edit the queue name (the string after '-q' flag) to reflect
the actual name of your partition.

(e) Once you have verified that all the above requirements are met, open all files with a 
.R extension and edit the first line of executable code to set library/data file paths 
as directed by the comments.  These will tell R where to load your libraries and find
the data files.


Workflow to reproduce Figure 4:

(1) From the command line of your cluster computing environment, type
either 'bsub <run_power_sim_chr5.bsub' or 'sbatch run_power_sim_chr5.sbatch' (without the quotes)
and press ENTER.

(2) Once all the jobs from step (1) have finished, run plot_fig4.R from within an R console.

This will produce a very close approximation of Figure 4 (not a perfect reproduction because we 
cannot control the random number generator of HAPGEN - it sets a seed according to the time of day).
